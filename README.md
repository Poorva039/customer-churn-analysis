# üìâ Customer Churn Analysis  
*Predicting Telecom Customer Retention Using Python*

---

## üß≠ Project Overview

This Python-based project analyzes customer churn patterns using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to customer attrition and predict which customers are likely to leave. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning.

### üîç Goals of the Project

- Explore key factors affecting customer churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, payment method)
- Visualize churn trends and identify high-risk customer segments
- Build a predictive model to classify churned vs. retained customers
- Recommend actionable insights for retention strategy

## üìä Key Analysis & Insights

- **Churn Rate**: ~26.5% of customers have churned
- **High Risk Groups**:
  - Month-to-month contracts
  - Customers with high monthly charges and short tenure
  - Users lacking support or additional services
- **Visualizations**:
  - Countplots, heatmaps, boxplots, and pairplots
  - Churn distribution by demographic and service attributes
  - Tenure group segmentation for targeted retention

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and analysis
- **Libraries**:  
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy`: Data manipulation and statistics  
  - `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`: Data visualization  
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning modeling (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Techniques**:
  - Label encoding, feature engineering
  - Classification model evaluation (precision, recall, f1-score)
  - Class imbalance analysis
